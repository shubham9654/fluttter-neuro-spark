# NeuroSpark – New User Guide

Welcome! This quick guide helps you register, sign in, and start using NeuroSpark.

## 1) Sign Up (Create Account)
- Open the app → tap **Create Account** (or go to `/signup`).
- Enter **Display Name**, **Email**, **Password**.
- Agree to Terms & Privacy → tap **Create Account**.
- You can also tap **Continue with Google** to create an account in one step.

## 2) Sign In
- From the landing screen tap **Sign In** (or `/login`).
- Enter your email + password **or** tap **Continue with Google**.
- If you previously created an account with Google, use the same Google login to access it.

## 3) Profile & Bio
- Go to **Settings → Edit Profile**.
- Update **Display Name** and **Bio**.
- Tap **Save**. Changes reflect immediately in the profile header.

## 4) Tasks & Focus
- **Brain Dump**: add quick tasks to your inbox.
- **Sort**: move tasks to **Today** or **Not Today**.
- **Focus Session**: start a 25‑minute timer; completing sessions earns XP/coins.

## 5) Rewards & Shop
- Open the **Dopamine Shop** to spend coins on items/themes.
- Coins are earned from tasks and focus sessions.

## 6) Notifications
- Enable notifications when prompted to receive task and focus reminders.

## 7) Sign Out / Switch Account
- In **Settings**, tap **Sign Out**.
- Local, user-scoped data (tasks, stats, sessions) is cleared before the next sign-in so accounts don’t mix.

## 8) Troubleshooting
- **Profile not updating**: ensure you’re online; changes save to Firebase and appear immediately.
- **Google Sign-In errors on Android**: confirm SHA-1 is added in Firebase Console.
- **Still seeing old data after switching users**: sign out, close the app, reopen, and sign back in; data is isolated per user.

Enjoy using NeuroSpark!
